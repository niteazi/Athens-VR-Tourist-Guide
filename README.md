### Athens Tourist Guide VR Application

This project is part of my dissertation with topic **Educational utilization of VR headsets**. The **Athens Tourist Guide** VR application provides users with an immersive experience of exploring the city’s historical landmarks while receiving detailed information from a virtual assistant. The assistant is programmed to answer a **set of predefined questions** related to various landmarks and tourist attractions in Athens. These predefined questions trigger specific answers, ensuring accurate and focused responses.

#### Key Features:
- **Predefined Answers for Common Questions**: The virtual assistant is equipped with predefined answers to a set of frequently asked questions about the landmarks, offering quick and consistent information.
- **Dynamic AI-Powered Responses**: If a user asks a question that is **not within the predefined set**, the assistant seamlessly connects to **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** to generate an appropriate response, ensuring that users can still get the information they need, even if it wasn’t anticipated.
- **Voice Interaction**: Users interact with the assistant through voice commands. If their query matches a predefined question, the system responds instantly with the prepared answer; otherwise, it dynamically retrieves information from ChatGPT.
- **VR Environment**: Users can virtually explore Athens landmarks, such as the Parthenon, Mount Lycabettus, and Syntagma Square, in a detailed 3D environment.
- **Google Maps Integration**: The app also incorporates Google Maps for real-world geographic visualization of Athens’ landmarks.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Unity**: For building the VR environment.
- **Meta Quest 2**: The VR headset platform.
- **Wit.ai**: Handles speech recognition for interacting with the virtual assistant.
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: Provides answers when predefined responses are unavailable.
- **Google Maps Platform**: Displays real-world locations and 3D terrain.
